# Experiment 3
## Combinational Circuits: Structural Modeling Simulation

**Overview:**

In lab3, we have implemented and done the simulation of combinational circuits using SystemVerilog on QuestaSim. The tasks involve designing, testing, and verifying logic circuits.
we are given two tasks in the lab 3.

###  TASK 1:
**Implementing the Given Circuit in QuestaSim**

- Implemented the logic circuit as in the lab manual.
- Used SystemVerilog to describe the circuit. And wrote the RTL and Test bench code for the circuit.
- Compiled and simulatec the files on questa.
- Verified the design by generating and analyzing the truth table and seeing its waves from Questasim.

**files uploaded**:
- RTL code of the circuit named as Task1.sv.
- docs file having the schematic of the circuit.
- constarints file generted for testing on FPGA.
- Test Bench code of circuit .

### TASK 2:
 **Full Adder RTL and Testbench Simulation**

- Compiled and debugged the given Full Adder RTL and testbench.
- Fixed syntax errors in the full_adder.sv and full_adder_tb.sv files.
- Simulated and verified the outputs in QuestaSim.

**Files uploaded**:
- Corrected RTL code of circuit.
- Corrected testbench of circuit.

## RESULTS:

- Successfully implemented and simulated both the given circuit and the Full Adder.
- Verified correctness through waveform analysis and truth table validation.
